# Chat implementation using RMI

## How to run

Keep in mind that in this project I had my .class files in the folder `~/ChatRMI/out/production/ChatRMI/chat/` 
which was auto-generated by the IntelliJ Idea IDE

The tree should look something like this:

- Compile (`javac`) all the classes and put them in the same way I showed you, including .sh files
- Fire up the Server running the `./launch_nanohttpd.sh` file
- Start up the RMI Registry `./launch_registry.sh` file
(if this does not execute you should try to make it executable with
`chmod +x launch_registry.sh`)
- Launch the Server 
- Launch the Client
