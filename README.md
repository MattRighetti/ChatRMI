# Chat implementation using RMI

## How to run

Keep in mind that in this project I had my .class files in the folder `~/ChatRMI/out/production/ChatRMI/`
which was auto-generated by the IntelliJ Idea IDE

The tree should look something like this:

    out
    └── production
                └── ChatRMI
                            ├── Client.class
                            ├── Controller.class
                            ├── Database.class
                            ├── Group.class
                            ├── Message.class
                            ├── MessageObserver.class
                            ├── RemoteController.class
                            ├── RemoteTextView.class
                            ├── Server.class
                            ├── TextView.class
                            └── User.class


- Compile (`javac`) all the classes and put them in the same way I showed you, including .sh files
- Fire up the Server running the `./launch_nano.sh` file
- Start up the RMI Registry `./launch_registry.sh` file and when asked type "locahost"
(if this does not execute you should try to make it executable with
`chmod +x launch_registry.sh`)
- Launch `./launch_server.sh`
- Launch `./launch_client.sh`
