#Chat implementation using RMI

##How to run

Keep in mind that in this project I had my .class files in the folder `~/ChatRMI/out/production/ChatRMI/chat/` 
which was auto-generated by the IntelliJ Idea IDE

- Fire up the Server running the `./launch_nanohttpd.sh` file
- Start up the RMI Registry `./compile_move.sh` file
(if this does not execute you should try to make it executable with
`chmod +x compile_move.sh`)
- Launch the Server 
- Launch the Client
